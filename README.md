# GoodWe API (oct 2018)

_This is a work in progress_

This node-based import script can be used to import data from the latest GoodWe API and upload it to PVOutput.org

## Prerequisites

- Linux or Mac. Windows might work, but I didn't test and honestly; I don't care 
- Shell access (and experience :)
- Node v8.9.0 or above
- NPM v5.8.0 or above

## Installation 

- Clone repo or download from releases-page
- `cd` into the downloaded/cloned folder
- run `npm i`
- Make `db`-folder writeable (easiest way; `chmod +w db/`)
- Setup environment (see "Environment")
- Transpile the code ; `npm run build`
- check if building succeeded
- link the cli-command; `npm link`

## Running

Currently this tool runs from commandline, possibly from a cronjob. I have not looked into daemonizing it yet, it's on the backlog.

_These examples run assuming you setup the environment correctly_

_Get stations_:

``` 
semsSync --list-powerstations
```

_Print last output_:

``` 
semsSync --station-id [stationID] --get-last-output
```

_Sync_:

``` 
semsSync --station-id [stationID] --sync PVOutput 
```

## Environment
These variables should be set from environment-variables or can be passed using CLI-arguments
```
GOODWE_LOGIN_API=https://globalapi.sems.com.cn/api/v1/
GOODWE_API_URI=https://euapi.sems.com.cn/api/
GOODWE_API_VERION=v2.0.4
GOODWE_CLIENT_TYPE=ios
CACHE_ID=7c3c61277bd8b4aa5efd3a5c755e6db5
CACHE_FOLDER=./db
GOODWE_USERNAME=<your goodwe-username>
GOODWE_PASSWORD=<your goodwe-password>
```

## CLI args
```--list-powerstations``` prints a list of powerstations connected to your account

```--get-last-output``` prints the last PAC value, expects the station-id in --station-id <station-id> *unfinished*

```--sync [target]``` syncs output to targets (comma-separated). Currently only one target is supported (which is PVOutput.org). Each target has a set of configuration options which are checked before executing the sync.

```--dry-run``` uses mock data instead of real data and does not post to targets

```--log-to-file [filename]``` write log to file instead of console.

## Targets

This tool is written to allow syncing of GoodWe-API-data to multiple targets. Currently PVOutput is the only target which is supported. Possibly more to come in the future:)

### PVOutput

Configuration options;

```--PVapiKey [key]``` the PVOutput API Key

```--PVSystemId [systemId]``` the PVOUtput systemID
