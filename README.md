# GoodWe API Synchronisation utility

_This is a work in progress but has been stable and running for 2 months_

This node-based import script can be used to import data from the latest GoodWe API and upload it to PVOutput.org.
The previous API from Goodwe has been deprecated and was supposed to be taken down in October 2018, it's still up & running though (dec.2018). To keep my PV data synced to PVOutput.org I've written this small utility. For now it only supports PVOutput.org, but I will take a look into syncing with Domoticz as well.


## Prerequisites

- Linux or Mac. Windows might work, but I didn't test and honestly; I don't care 
- Shell access (and experience :)
- Node v8.9.0 or above
- NPM v5.8.0 or above

## Installation 

- Clone repo or download from releases-page
- `cd` into the downloaded/cloned folder
- run `npm i`
- Make `db`-folder writeable (easiest way; `chmod +w db/`)
- Setup environment (see "Environment")
- Transpile the code ; `npm run build`
- check if building succeeded
- link the cli-command; `npm link`

## Running

Currently this tool runs from commandline, usually from a cronjob. I have not looked into daemonizing it yet, it's on the backlog.

_These examples run assuming you setup the environment correctly_

_Get stations_:

``` 
semsSync --list-powerstations
```

_Print last output_:

``` 
semsSync --station-id [stationID] --get-last-output
```

_Sync_:

``` 
semsSync --station-id [stationID] --sync PVOutput 
```

## Environment
These variables should be set from environment-variables or can be passed using CLI-arguments
```
GOODWE_LOGIN_API=https://globalapi.sems.com.cn/api/v1/
GOODWE_API_URI=https://euapi.sems.com.cn/api/
GOODWE_USERNAME=[Goodwe username]
GOODWE_PASSWORD=[Goodwe pass]
GOODWE_API_VERION=v2.0.4
GOODWE_CLIENT_TYPE=ios
CACHE_ID=[insert random GUID here]
CACHE_FOLDER=./db
PVapiKey=[API Key From PVOutput.org]
PVSystemId=[SystemID from PVOutput.org]
```

## CLI args
```--list-powerstations``` prints a list of powerstations connected to your account

```--get-last-output``` prints the last PAC value, expects the station-id in --station-id <station-id> *unfinished*

```--sync [target]``` syncs output to targets (comma-separated). Currently only one target is supported (which is PVOutput.org). Each target has a set of configuration options which are checked before executing the sync.

```--dry-run``` uses mock data instead of real data and does not post to targets

```--log-to-file [filename]``` write log to file instead of console.

## Targets

This tool is written to allow syncing of GoodWe-API-data to multiple targets. Currently PVOutput is the only target which is supported. Possibly more to come in the future:)

### PVOutput

Configuration options;

```--PVapiKey [key]``` the PVOutput API Key

```--PVSystemId [systemId]``` the PVOUtput systemID


## Cronjob

1. Edit your crontab;

``` 
crontab -e 
```

2. Copy the contents of your env file to the top of the crontab
3. Paste the following at the end of your crontab, _this will run the semsSync task every 5 minutes_

```
*/5 * * * *  /[Path to]node /[path to the GoodWe package]/dist/index.js --sync PVOutput --station-id [station-ID you get from running semsSync --list-powerstations] 2>&1 | while read line; do echo `/bin/date` "$line" >> /[path to you log-directory]/semsSync.log; done
```

### Example

My Crontab looks like this _(I have NVM running, so node is probably in a different path from most stock setups)_:


```
GOODWE_LOGIN_API=https://globalapi.sems.com.cn/api/v1/
GOODWE_API_URI=https://euapi.sems.com.cn/api/
GOODWE_USERNAME= [xxxx]
GOODWE_PASSWORD= [xxxx]
GOODWE_API_VERION=v2.0.4
GOODWE_CLIENT_TYPE=ios
CACHE_ID=7c3c61277bd8b4aa5efd3a5c755e6db5
CACHE_FOLDER=./db
PVapiKey= [xxxx]
PVSystemId= [xxx]

*/5 * * * *  /root/.nvm/versions/node/v8.14.0/bin/node /root/goodwe-api/dist/index.js --sync PVOutput --station-id 5368e8a7-3966-4250-8c0d-0d90faad52eb 2>&1 | while read line; do echo `/bin/date` "$line" >> /var/log/semsSync.log; done

```

### View logs

To monitor the log, you can use `tail`:

```
tail -F /var/log/semsSync.log
```
